# Deshawn Sambrano's Portfolio


Here are a few different project that demonstrate my versatility as a Data Scientist, Applied Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer.

## [Bayesian Statistics](bayes/bayes.md)

This [project](bayes/bayes.md) demonstrates my ability to use and easily explain Bayesian Statistics. Specifically, these plots show how the posterior (the final prediction of the model) changes as you adjust the prior (the background knowledge of the model). 

As show with the image on the left, if you don't give your model the proper prior (background knowledge of what is likely to happen) it can be overconfident which can lead to inaccurate predictions and lost of revenue. In contrast, the plot on the right has a good prior making it more robust to random fluctuations and produces much more stable results yielding more accurate forecasts.

## [Forecasting Risky Decision Making](bayes/bayes.md)

For this project, I created a custom machine learning model to forecast risky decision making for lotteries.

## [Interactive Data and Analysis Demonstrations](bayes/bayes.md)
<!-- ![](bayes/output_3_1.png) -->

Below are a couple on live data visualization and analysis demonstrations. You are given some simulated data and as you adjust the different parameters of the dataset you can see how it changes that data visually as well as from a statistical standpoint. These demonstrations were used to teach 101 students statistics at Harvard University.
